## Hi there 👋,

I'm Christopher Fotos. Building web applications isn't just my career, it's my passion. I love using JavaScript and its frameworks to deliver complex, custom functionality that goes beyond conventional web development. It's been my hobby, and now I'm turning it into my career!

## 🧐 About

- 📚‍ I love learning, and I especially love teaching! I recently attended a web dev bootcamp where I spent lots of time teaching and supporting my classmates.
- 😄 I recently participated in (and WON!!) my first hackathon! check out my project [here](https://christopherfotos.github.io/mnma/)
- 📚 I'm currently learning:
  - Typescript
  - Go
- 🎓 I'm a recent bootcamp graduate, but I developed a passion for programming long before attending a bootcamp 🤓
- 🏗️ Projects I'm most proud of:

  - [BitBeat](https://bitbeat.herokuapp.com/): A browser-based beat sequencer made with react. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOQPBKrlqUU) to see a video of me demonstrating it!
  - [props.js](https://github.com/ChristopherFotos/props.js): a JavaSctipt library for creating games and animations on HTML5 canvas. A work in progress, I might even rebuild it in typescript!!!
